    Quantum control is an important logical primitive of quantum computing programs, and an important concept for graphical rewriting in quantum graphical calculi.
    In this work, we investigate the algebraic structure of \emph{controlled diagrams} in the ZXW-calculus --- diagrams extended with an additional qubit wire for triggering an operation on or off.
    By formalising these properties of quantum control as a higher-order map, we enable powerful new graphical rewrite rules, going beyond prior calculi for which the allowed parameters are restricted to phases.

    First, we prove that controlled square matrices form a ring, and thus admit expressive rewrite rules. We also show that controlled states form a ring, which is isomorphic to the ring of multilinear polynomials. Putting these together, we have completeness for polynomials over same-size square matrices, implying that these rules suffice to perform any factorisation of any qubit Hamiltonian.
