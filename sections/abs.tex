    An important concept for graphical rewriting in the ZXW-calculus is a \emph{controlled diagram} --- a diagram extended with an additional input wire for triggering the operation on or off. In this work, we investigate the algebraic structure of controlled diagrams. First, we show that controlled matrices form a ring, yielding powerful rewrite rules for large classes of diagrams; we also show that controlled states form a ring, in this case isomorphic to the ring of multilinear polynomials. Augmenting the ZXW-calculus with controlled square matrices as black-box generators, we prove completeness for polynomials over same-size square matrices. We apply this finding to show that it is unlikely that arbitrary quantum states can be efficiently rewritten to any arithmetic ZXW diagram, as this would imply $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NQP}$. Through formalising the algebraic properties of quantum control, we give rise to powerful new graphical rewrite rules for black-box diagrams.
